YIKES Inc. Simple Taxonomy Ordering
=============

This plugin is quite similar to [Simple Page Ordering](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/), but allows you to easily re-order taxonomies using drag and drop functionality.

##### Setup
1. Install and activate the plugin
2. If you need to enable sorting on default WordPress taxonomies, please see:
3. If you would like to enable taxonomy sorting on custom post type taxonomies, please see:
4. Once enabled, you can drag & drop re-order your taxonomies. Whenever '[get_terms()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_terms)' is used to display your terms, they will display in the order you've set.

#### Issues?
If you're running into any issues, we would love to hear about it. Please head over to the [Simple Taxonomy Orering Issue Tracker](https://github.com/yikesinc/yikes-simple-taxonomy-ordering) and create a new issue.

**Originally built by YIKES Inc. | Inspired by [Simple Page Ordering](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/)**
