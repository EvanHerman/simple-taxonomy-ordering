Quickly and easily reorder taxonomy terms with an easy to use and intuitive drag and drop interface.

== Description ==

Order all of the taxonomy terms on your site with a simple to use, intuitive drag and drop interface. The plugin works for WordPress core taxonomies -- Categories and Tags -- and any custom taxonomies you have created.

Activate the plugin, enable your taxonomy on the settings page, and drag and drop the taxonomies into the desired position. It couldn't be easier.

On the front end of the site your taxonomy terms will display in the order set in the dashboard.

Integrates well with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/">Easy Digital Downloads</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce</a>, allowing you to re-order product categories and terms.

We've also built in support within the plugin itself. On the edit taxonomy page, click on the 'Help' tab in the top right of the screen to display additional help.

<strong>Requires WordPress 4.4 or later, due to the use of the term meta.</strong>

== Other Notes ==

**Filters**

* yikes-mailchimp-form-title-FORM_ID - alter the output of the form title of the specified form

**Query Usage**

* If you're trying to query for taxonomy terms (e.g. using `WP_Query` or functions like `get_terms()`), and you'd like them to be returned in the order specified by the plugin, you need to add the tax_position parameter in your call. For example: `'meta_key' => 'tax_position'` and  `'orderby' => 'tax_position'`. Thanks to @certainlyakey on GitHub for pointing this out.

== Screenshots ==
